# PredictiveMapper

## Overview

PredictiveMapper is an AI-powered **Predictive Spatial Modeler** designed to rethink how environments are understood, navigated, and mapped. Unlike traditional systems that rely on heavy, continuous sensor input, PredictiveMapper starts with **external geodata predictions** and then uses a camera only to verify and update those predictions. This reduces computational load dramatically, enabling use on resource-limited devices while also opening up a powerful new method of **map creation and updating**.

## Core Features

### Predictive Spatial Reasoning

* Uses a **probabilistic, graph-based model** to generate conceptual blueprints of spaces.
* Infers likely room layouts, dimensions, and relationships from geospatial data.
* Provides an AI with a **proactive mental map** of its surroundings.

### Efficient Localization

* Localizes itself by matching key architectural features from a **single camera image** to its predictive model.
* Avoids building maps from scratch.
* Enables rapid, lightweight, and precise navigation with minimal sensor input.

### Procedural Sketching

* Converts internal spatial models into **simple 2D sketches** for human readability.
* Provides conceptual maps without GPU-heavy 3D rendering.

### Mapping Infrastructure Extension

* Beyond navigation, PredictiveMapper can **build and update official map data** with unprecedented efficiency:

  * Uses camera images + prediction confirmations to refine stored geodata.
  * Updates maps **faster than satellites** and **cheaper than Street View vans or GoPro crowd-mapping**.
  * Produces **self-healing maps**: every verified prediction strengthens accuracy.
* This enables a **living map** that stays current in real time, especially valuable for:

  * Cities with rapid development.
  * Disaster zones where roads/buildings change overnight.
  * Areas poorly covered by existing maps.

## How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion**: Takes an address or coordinates to pull public data like building footprints and lot size.
2. **Internal Modeling**: A neural network generates a probable floor plan with predicted room sizes and relationships.
3. **Localization**: A single image of a known feature (e.g., a front door, tree line, street facade) is used to match its predicted location in the model.
4. **Verification and Update**: As the camera captures more, the model corrects predictions and updates sketches.
5. **Map Feedback**: Confirmed corrections are written back into the map dataset, continuously improving it.

## Benefits

* **Low-Resource Operation**: Runs without GPU-heavy pipelines, suitable for Raspberry Pi or lightweight robotics.
* **Rapid Deployment**: Can produce a functional internal map from geodata + a single camera.
* **Scalable**: Works from single rooms to entire city blocks.
* **Next-Gen Mapping**: Creates a pathway toward a self-updating, crowd-fed mapping system.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Core Model

* Predictive mapping from geodata.
* Simple 2D sketch output.
* Run on desktop with free/open datasets (e.g., OpenStreetMap).

### Phase 2 — City/Building Navigation

* Use single-camera verification.
* Implement prediction correction.
* Deploy on Raspberry Pi + camera for low-power robots.

### Phase 3 — Offline/Online Mapping Extension

* Offline: Use stored geodata for areas without connectivity.
* Online: Feed confirmed predictions back into a **shared mapping system**.
* First use cases: building interiors, city blocks, jungle/forest navigation.

### Phase 4 — Living Map Platform

* Crowd-sourced global updates.
* PredictiveMapper becomes an **alternative to satellite + van mapping**, delivering real-time, ground-truth accuracy.

## Use Cases

* **Robotics & Drones**: Lightweight navigation without LiDAR or multi-camera rigs.
* **Disaster Response**: Quickly remap damaged areas without needing satellites.
* **Smart Cities**: Continuous updates for urban planning and autonomous transport.
* **Global Mapping**: Community-driven alternative to Google Maps, updated live from devices.

---

## Tech Stack (Planned)

* **Data Sources**: OpenStreetMap, public geospatial datasets.
* **Modeling**: Python + PyTorch/TensorFlow (lightweight models first).
* **Hardware**: Raspberry Pi + camera (future: drones/robots).
* **Visualization**: Procedural 2D sketches (Matplotlib / lightweight rendering).

## Why PredictiveMapper Matters

Big players like Google or Apple rely on **expensive pipelines** (satellites, Street View vans, LiDAR). PredictiveMapper proposes a new paradigm:

* **Predict First, Verify Later** → saves compute + energy.
* **Crowd Update** → scalable, cheap, real-time.
* **Resource Friendly** → works where GPUs and LiDAR rigs are impossible.

This approach could democratize mapping, making **up-to-date, high-accuracy maps accessible worldwide**, especially in areas ignored by traditional mapping giants.
